## CUSTOMIZING THE HTML

### Replacing Product Links

Find these lines in the HTML:
```html
<a href="#" class="product-btn">Add to Cart</a>
<a href="#" class="product-btn">Name Your Price</a>
<a href="#" class="product-btn">Join the Network</a>
<a href="#" class="hero-cta">Browse All Territories</a>
```

Replace `href="#"` with your actual Payhip product URLs:
```html
<a href="https://payhip.com/b/YOUR_PRODUCT_ID" class="product-btn">Add to Cart</a>
```

### Adding Hero Image

The hero section currently has a gradient background. To add the "Unapologetically Us" portrait:

**Method 1: Background Image in CSS**
Add to the `.hero` style:
```css
.hero {
    background-image: url('YOUR_IMAGE_URL.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
}
```

**Method 2: Payhip Banner**
If using Payhip's theme builder:
1. Go to Settings > Storefront > Theme
2. Upload banner image
3. Adjust banner height to match hero section

---

## COLOR CUSTOMIZATION

The HTML uses your brand colors:
- **Primary Gold**: #D7B43A (CTA borders, accents)
- **Diaspora Red**: #D52A1D (Primary CTA buttons)
- **Market Red**: #B7261C (Hover states)
- **Deep Green**: #2F7D55 (Community)
- **Crimson Red**: #C73129 (Media)
- **Ruby Red**: #B0201E (Music)
- **Star Gold**: #F5C542 (World)
- **Book Beige**: #C4A46D (Law)
- **Emerald Green**: #2BA84A (Status indicators)

These are already applied throughout the HTML. No changes needed unless you want to adjust the palette.

1. Launch main storefront with 3 products only:
   - Annual 12.12 Report
   - Why 121212
   - 121212 Membership
2. Keep vendor tiers and territories as "Coming Soon" sections
3. Focus on proving core commerce

### PHASE 2: Vendor Marketplace (Week 2-4)
1. Launch vendor tier products
2. Begin accepting vendor applications
3. Add "Featured Vendors" section once you have 5+ approved

### PHASE 3: Territory Expansion (Month 2)
1. Launch territory application system
2. Approve first 3-5 territory leaders

This phased approach creates proof-of-commerce incrementally while maintaining institutional credibility.

## FINAL NOTES

**This is not just a store — it's proof-of-commerce infrastructure.**

Every section (categories, products, vendor tiers, territories) demonstrates active intent across multiple trademark classes:
- .market (Marketplace section, vendor tiers)
- .community (Community section, territory system)
- .tv (Media section, streaming references)
- .music (Music & Arts section, creative commerce)
- .world (World section, global diaspora)
- .law (Law & Policy section, legal education)

The HTML is timestamped proof that 121212 operates across all these domains simultaneously.

**Keep this file dated and archived.** It's evidence, not just design.
