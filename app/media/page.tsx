          <h2>Happy MLK Day: The Work Continues</h2>

          <p>
            Today we pause—not merely to remember, but to reckon. Martin Luther King Jr. Day is not a passive holiday. It is an active summons. A day that asks us not only what we believe, but what we are building.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dr. King understood something that builders understand: vision without structure is sentimentality, and structure without vision is machinery. He dreamed, yes—but he also organized. He marched, but he also strategized. He spoke to the soul of a nation while drafting the blueprints for its transformation.
          </p>

          <div className="info-box">
            <p><em>&quot;We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.&quot;</em></p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: 'right', marginTop: '1rem' }}>— Martin Luther King Jr., Letter from Birmingham Jail</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            These words, written from a jail cell in 1963, carry an architecture of their own. <strong>An inescapable network of mutuality.</strong> Not a suggestion of connection, but an assertion of it. Not a hope for interdependence, but a declaration that it already exists—whether we honor it or not.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why 121212 exists. Not as charity, but as recognition. When Black creators are seen, supported, credited, and paid, the entire network strengthens. When one thread is lifted, the garment rises. Economic infrastructure is not separate from the dream—it is the dream made operational.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dr. King also reminded us that transformation requires more than good intentions:
          </p>

          <div className="info-box">
            <p><em>&quot;The time is always right to do what is right.&quot;</em></p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: 'right', marginTop: '1rem' }}>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            There is no perfect moment. There is no ideal condition. The work does not wait for permission or comfort. It asks only for commitment—today, now, with whatever tools are at hand. The builder does not delay until the season is favorable; the builder breaks ground because the ground is there.
          </p>

          <p>
            And yet, Dr. King knew that urgency must be paired with endurance. Quick victories are rare in the work of justice. The arc is long. The labor is generational. This is why he spoke not only of action, but of persistence:
          </p>

          <div className="info-box">
            <p><em>&quot;If you can&apos;t fly then run, if you can&apos;t run then walk, if you can&apos;t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.&quot;</em></p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: 'right', marginTop: '1rem' }}>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            This is the rhythm of building. Some days you ship. Some days you crawl. But the direction never changes. Forward. Toward visibility. Toward sovereignty. Toward a world where the network of mutuality is not just acknowledged, but resourced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, we honor Dr. King not with stillness, but with motion. Not with mere remembrance, but with continuation. The dream was never meant to be a museum piece—it was meant to be a foundation.
          </p>

          <p>
            So we build. We ship. We prove. We scale. And we remember that every transaction, every timestamp, every deliverable is a thread in the garment he described.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Happy MLK Day.</strong> The work continues.
