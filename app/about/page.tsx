          <h2>Origin</h2>
          <p>
            121212 began as a number. It became something far more precise: <strong>a color</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the language of screens, colors are rendered through hex codes—six-character sequences that instruct light itself. <strong>#121212</strong> is one such code: a near-black, favored in modern design for its clarity over pure darkness, its gentleness upon the eye, its quiet authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            This discovery became the origin story. For 121212 is not merely a brand. It is both signal and foundation.
          </p>
          <div className="info-box">
            <p><strong>As a signal:</strong> 12:12 appears as a prompt—a summons to move, to ship, to publish, to build without hesitation.</p>
            <p><strong>As a foundation:</strong> #121212 is the frame, the backdrop, the container that renders all else readable and potent.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="content-section">
          <h2>The Mission</h2>
          <p>
            From this foundation, the mission crystallized with unmistakable clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            121212 exists to ensure that <strong>Black creators are seen, supported, credited, and paid</strong>—in a world where visibility and distribution remain unevenly granted. Not through spectacle, but through infrastructure: clean pages, proof-of-commerce products, and repeatable systems that transform work into receipts, and receipts into momentum.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a builder&apos;s network. Execution-first. Proof-driven. Designed to lower the cost of beginning and accelerate the arrival of legitimacy.

          <h2>The Threefold Darkness</h2>
          <p>
            121212 carries a deeper symbolic register: <strong>the threefold darkness within the being</strong>—not evil, but <em>depth</em>. The interior chamber where intention is forged before it finds expression in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solomon&apos;s Temple offers a fitting metaphor for this inner architecture: the movement from outer courts into deeper chambers, into the sanctum where what is most sacred is formed and protected. In this light, <strong>#121212</strong> transcends mere aesthetic—it embodies <em>inner containment</em>. The darkness is not absence but sanctuary. The stillness where vision becomes real.
          </p>
          <div className="info-box">
            <p>Thus 121212 stands as a black foundation in two senses:</p>
            <p><strong>Visually</strong>, as #121212—the color beneath all colors.</p>
            <p><strong>Symbolically</strong>, as the interior chamber where clarity, power, and purpose are assembled before their release into the world.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="content-section">
          <h2>Why The Name Matters</h2>
          <p>
            121212 is memorable as a number, meaningful as a signal, and literal as a color: <strong>#121212</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is both the reminder and the frame: when the pattern appears, you move—and you move with structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are building something real, 121212 is built to help you ship it, prove it, and scale it.
